       "\"Teacher: (generic)Hi Mariana, please talk me through your solution|EOM|Student: Sure. I started by letting x be the number of spoons Julia bought. Then I added 5 to x to get the total number of spoons. Next, I subtracted 3 from the total number of spoons to get the number of spoons left. Finally, I set up an equation and solved for x, which was 4. So Julia bought a package of 4 spoons.|EOM|Teacher: (focus)Okay -  you've overcomplicated this. Let's start again. We know Julia has 12 spoons when setting the table. We also know she used three whilst sampling her stew. How many is that altogether?|EOM|Student: 12 - 3 = 9. So Julia had 9 spoons left when setting the table.|EOM|Teacher: (telling)No, you need to add as she still has the spoons, 3 have just been used|EOM|Student: Oh, right. 12 + 3 = 15. So Julia had 15 spoons altogether. And since her husband gave her 5 spoons, she must have bought 10 spoons.|EOM|Teacher: (generic)Yes, that's it|EOM|Student: So Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.\""
