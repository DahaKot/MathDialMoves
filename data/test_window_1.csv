On Friday, the mechanic earned 12 x $40 = $480 for repairing car tires, so the revenue on Friday is higher by $480 - $520 = $-40.

Student: Sure. I started by figuring out that Marcy was entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years. So, her annual pension after 20 years would be $50,000 x 100% = $50,000. Then, I calculated that for the next 10 years, she would be entitled to an additional 5% x 10 = 50% of the value of the pension. So, her annual pension after 30 years would be $50,000 + ($50,000 x 50%) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

Student: Sure. I started by letting x be the total number of cards Kenny started with. Then, I realized that he kept 1/3 of them, so he sold 2/3 of them, which is 2/3x. Since he sold them for $1.5 each, he earned 1.5(2/3x) = 3x/2 dollars. I then realized that he wanted to end up with $50 spending cash, so he needed to earn $100 + $50 = $150 in total. Therefore, 3x/2 = $150. From there, I solved for x and got x = 100. This meant that Kenny started with 100 cards.

Student: Okay, let's try again. 

Let's call the number of spoons Julia bought ""x"". 
Her husband bought 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons is now x + 5. 
Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she had 12 spoons left. 
We know that the total number of spoons is x + 5, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 5 = 12 

Subtracting 5 from both sides: 

x = 7 

So Julia bought a package of 7 spoons.

Student: Yes, you could also subtract the 8 cookies left from the total of 150 cookies and then divide the result by the number of neighbors to get the amount each neighbor was supposed to take. Then subtract that amount from the total to get the amount Sarah took. So 150 - 8 = 142, and 142 / 15 = 9.5. Then 9.5 - 10 = -0.5, which means Sarah took 10 + 0.5 = 10.5 cookies.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher:
Student: Sure. Ken had fifty pencils. He wanted to share some of them with his two friends, Manny and Nilo. So he gave ten pencils to Manny and then gave Nilo an additional ten pencils. This means that he gave a total of 10 + 10 = 20 pencils to Manny and Nilo. Then I used algebra to figure out how many pencils Ken kept. I let x be the number of pencils Ken gave to Nilo. Then x + 10 is the number of pencils Ken gave to Manny. So x + (x + 10) = 20. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 10 = 20, 2x = 10, and x = 5. Therefore, Ken gave 5 + 10 = 15 pencils to Manny and Nilo. Thus, Ken kept 50 - 15 = 35 pencils.

Student: Sure. I started by figuring out that one and a half increase in productivity means an increase of 150%, since one and a half is equal to one plus a half, or 1.5 = 1 + 0.5 = 150%. Then, I used that information to calculate that if the Albaszu machine was cutting 10 trees daily, then its productivity has increased by 150%, which means it is now cutting 10 x 150% = 15 trees daily.

Student: Sure. I started by assuming that the cost of a single brown sock was x. Then, I used the given information that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock to calculate that two white socks would cost x + 0.25. Since two white socks cost 45 cents, I set up an equation to solve for x. After simplifying the equation, I got x = 22.25. This means that a single brown sock costs 22.25 cents. So, 15 brown socks would cost 15 x 22.25 = $333.75 cents.

Then, when I simplified the equation, I should have gotten 2x = 0.45 instead of 2x = 44.5. After dividing both sides by 2, I would have gotten x = 0.225, which is the same as x = 22.50.

Then I multiplied this by the number of times she goes up and down in a day, which is 5 and 3 respectively, to get 6 x 5 = 30 flights of stairs for going up and 6 x 3 = 18 flights of stairs for going down. Finally, I added these two numbers together to get my answer of 30 + 18 = 48 flights of stairs in a single day.

Student: Sure. First, I let x be the number of rounds George needs to fill the pool. Then, I calculated the number of rounds Harry needs to fill the pool by using the equation (110 - 2x) / 3. After that, I combined the two equations to get 2x + 3[(110 - 2x) / 3] = 110. After simplifying the equation, I got -2x = -110, and then I solved for x, which is 55.

Student: Sure. So, I started by recognizing that the amoeba reproduces every two days, so the number of amoebae after n days is 2^n. Then, I wanted to solve for n when 2^n = 16. To do this, I took the logarithm of both sides to base 2, which gave me n*log2(2) = 4. I then divided both sides by log2(2) to get n = 4. Therefore, it will take 4 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

Since it takes two days for one amoeba to divide into two amoebae, it will take 8 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

Student: Sure. I started by calculating how much Hillary spends on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday newspapers. I multiplied the cost of each paper, $0.50, by 3, as she buys three papers each day. This gave me a total of $1.50 per day. I then multiplied this by 8, as there are 8 weeks in the time period, giving me a total of $36. Then, I calculated how much she spends on the Sunday paper, which is $2.00 per week. I multiplied this by 8, as there are 8 weeks in the time period, giving me a total of $16. So, I added the two totals together, $36 + $16 = $52, which is how much she spends on newspapers over 8 weeks.

That was 45 minutes in the current maze plus 50 minutes for each of the 4 other mazes, which added up to 245 minutes.
