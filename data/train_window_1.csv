Student: Sure. I started by calculating how much water the coach would need for all the players. I multiplied 30 players by 200 milliliters of water, which gave me a total of 6000 milliliters, or 6 liters.

Student: I started by figuring out how much fuel was used between November 1 and January 1. I subtracted the amount of fuel left on January 1 (180 L) from the amount of fuel in the tank when it was first filled (3000 L). This gave me 2820 L. Then I figured out how much fuel was used between January 1 and May 1. Since the tank was filled again on January 1, I assumed that the same amount of fuel (3000 L) was used. Finally, I figured out how much fuel was used between May 1 and when Mr. Fortchaud stopped heating. I subtracted the amount of fuel left when he stopped heating (1238 L) from the amount of fuel in the tank when it was filled (3000 L). This gave me 1762 L.

Student: Sure. I started by assuming that the computer costs x dollars. Then I added the cost of the fridge, which is x + $500, and the cost of the TV, which is $600. That gave me a total cost of x + $1100. Then, I set up an equation using the given information that the total budget is $1600, so x + $500 + $600 = $1600. I then simplified the equation to x + $1100 = $1600 and subtracted $1100 from both sides to get x = $500. So, the computer costs $500.

Student: Sure. I started by noting that Jack's total time to run up the hill was 19 seconds for the first half plus x seconds for the second half, where x is the time it took him to run up the second half. I then noted that Jill's total time to run up the hill was x plus 7 plus 32 seconds. Since they both ran up the same hill, their total time should be the same, so I set up an equation: 19 + x = x + 7 + 32. I then simplified and solved for x, which gave me x = 20. Therefore, it took Jack 20 seconds to run up the second half of the hill.

Finally, I added the 3 stamps Tonya had before the trade and the 20 stamps she got from Jimmy, so she has a total of 20+3 = 23 stamps left.

Student: Sure. I started by letting X be the original price of Liz's car. She sold it at 80% of X, which is 0.8X. Then, I found that the proceeds from the sale is 0.8X, and she needs $4,000 more to buy a new $30,000 car. So, I set up the equation 0.8X + $4,000 = $30,000. Then, I subtracted $4,000 from both sides, which gave me 0.8X = $26,000. After that, I divided both sides by 0.8, which gave me X = $32,500. Finally, I found that her new car is $32,500 - 0.8X = $32,500 - $26,000 = $6,500 cheaper than what she originally paid for her old car.

Student: Sure. I started by calculating the total number of salmon in the river now. I multiplied the initial number of salmon (500) by 10, since the problem said the number of salmon increased by ten times. So, the total number of salmon in the river now is 10*500 = 5000. Then, I assumed that the total number of fish in the river is the same as the number of salmon, since no other fish was mentioned in the problem.

I did this by subtracting 3/7 from 1, which gave me 4/7. I then assumed that her original amount of money was x, so 4/7 of x would be equal to x - 24. I then simplified the equation by multiplying both sides by 7, which gave me 4x = 7x - 168. I then subtracted 4x from both sides, which gave me 3x = 168. Finally, I divided both sides by 3, which gave me x = 56. Half of Jenny's original amount of money is 56/2 = $28.

Student: Sure. I started by letting g be the number of girls at the event. Then I used the given information that the difference between the number of boys and girls is 400.

Student: Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the cookie jar and ate them. Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar. But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back. His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies. So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later. The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.

To solve this problem, I used the information given to calculate the number of cookies taken out of the jar. Firstly, Lou Senior ate 3 cookies and then put 2 back, so he effectively ate 3-2=1 cookie. Secondly, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar. So, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar is 1+7 = 8 cookies. If 8 cookies were half of the jar, then the whole jar had 8 x 2 = 16 cookies. Since 8 cookies were taken out, there are 16-8 = 8 cookies remaining in the jar.

Student: Sure. I started by letting x be the length of the base of the triangle. Then I used the given information that the sum of the three sides is 50 and the right side is 2 cm longer than the left side, which has a value of 12 cm. I then set up an equation to solve for x, which is 2x + 14 = 50. I then subtracted 14 from both sides to get 2x = 36. Finally, I divided both sides by 2 to get x = 18, which is the value of the triangle base.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher:
Student: Sure. The left side of the triangle has a value of 12 cm. We can use that to find the value of the base. We know that the sum of the three sides is 50, so the right side must be 12 + 2, which is 14 cm. Then, the base must be 50 - 14 - 12, which is 24 cm.

Student: Sure. First, I calculated that the bakery earns 3 x $4 = $12 for each pie. Then, I multiplied that by 12 to get the total amount the bakery earns for all 12 pies, which is $12 x 12 = $144.

The cost of each pair of drapes is $60.00, so 6 pairs will cost 60 x 6 = $360.00.

I also knew that Pete's hand-walking speed was 1/4 of Tracy's cartwheeling speed, so I converted Tracy's speed to miles per hour and simplified the equation to get x = 2 mph. Finally, I multiplied 3x to get Pete's backward walking speed, which was 6 mph.

Student: Let x be the length of the crooked part of the river.
Then, the length of the straight part of the river is x/3.
And we know that the total length of the river is 80 miles.
So, we have the equation x + x/3 = 80.
Simplifying the equation, we get 4x/3 = 80.
Solving for x, we get x = 60.
Therefore, the length of the straight part of the river is x/3 = 60/3 = 20 miles.

Student: Hi! Yes, I read the question carefully. The question is asking how many kitchens are there on the entire space station. To solve this, I first figured out that each cylindrical structure has 12 + 7 + x = 19 + x rooms, where x is the number of kitchens. Then, since there are three cylindrical structures, the total number of rooms is 3(19+x) = 57+3x. We know that the total number of rooms is 72, so 57+3x = 72. Subtracting 57 from both sides gives 3x = 15. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 kitchens on the entire space station.

Student: Sure, I started by calculating the total number of tractor-days. The two tractors worked for 2 days for a total of 2*2 = 4 tractor-days. Similarly, the seven tractors worked for 3 days for a total of 7*3 = 21 tractor-days. Together, the tractors worked for 4+21 = 25 tractor-days.

Next, I calculated the number of acres that need to be planted per day to meet the deadline. To plant 1700 acres in 5 days, they need to plant 1700/5 = 340 acres per day.

Finally, I calculated the number of acres each tractor needs to plant per day. Therefore, each tractor needs to plant 340/25 = 13.6 acres per day (rounded to one decimal place).

Mary gave her 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening, so Luna has eaten 2 cups in total. Frank gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much (2 x 1 = 2 cups) in the late evening, so Luna has eaten 1 + 2 = 3 cups in total.

Student: Sure! First, I let X be the original price of Liz's car. Then, I used the fact that she sold it at 80% of X, which is 0.8X. So, the proceeds from the sale is 0.8X. Since she needs $4,000 more to buy a new $30,000 car, I set up an equation: 0.8X + $4,000 = $30,000. Then, I subtracted $4,000 from both sides to get 0.8X = $26,000. After that, I divided both sides by 0.8 to get X = $32,500. This means that her new car is $32,500 - 0.8X = $32,500 - $26,000 = $6,500 cheaper than what she originally paid for her old car.

To cover 600 inches, I divided 600 by 24 which is 25 rungs. Then I multiplied 25 rungs by 18 inches to get the total length of the rungs which is 25 x 18 = 450 inches.

He's 27 years old, so 3 years ago he was 27+3 = 30 years old. Then I figured out that in 5 years, James will be 30+5 = 35 years old. Next, I used the fact that in 5 years, Matt will be twice James' age to figure out Matt's current age. I let x be Matt's current age and set up the equation 2(x+5) = 35. I then expanded the left side of the equation to get 2x+10 = 35. After subtracting 10 from both sides, I got 2x = 25. Dividing both sides by 2 gave me x = 12.5, so Matt is currently 12.5 years old.

Student: I started with 2 dozen eggs, which is equal to 24 eggs. Then I remembered that 3 eggs broke and twice as many cracked. So 3 x 2 = 6 eggs cracked. So the number of perfect eggs is 24 - 6 = 18. Then I realized I had made a mistake and the number of perfect eggs is actually 15. So the difference between the perfect eggs and the cracked eggs is 15 - 6 = 9.

Then I calculated the cost of the 14-year-old's ticket, which is 11. Then I calculated the cost of the 10-year-old's ticket, which is 8. Lastly, I calculated the cost of the 7-year-old's ticket, which is also 8. Adding up all the ticket prices, I got 22 + 18 + 8 + 11 + 8 + 8 = 75.

Student: To calculate the number of dozen cupcakes I can bake and ice, I first need to find out how many cups of sugar I have. I have 3 cups of sugar at home and 2 bags of sugar from the store, each containing 6 cups. So I have 3 + 2 x 6 = 15 cups of sugar. Then I need to figure out how many cupcakes I can make with the sugar I have. Since 1 cup of sugar is needed for 12 cupcakes, I can make 15 / 1 = 15 dozen cupcakes. Then I need to figure out how many cupcakes worth of frosting I can make. Since I need 2 cups of sugar for a dozen cupcakes, I can make 15 x 2 = 30 cupcakes worth of frosting. Finally, I need to figure out how many dozen cupcakes I can ice. I can ice 30 / 12 = 2.5 dozen cupcakes. Since I can't make half a dozen cupcakes, the maximum number of dozens I can bake and ice is 15.

Student: To calculate the point at which the break happened from the top of the pole, I subtracted the length of the bottom part of the flagpole (10 feet) from the total length of the flagpole (12 feet). This gave me 2 feet, which is the length of the top part of the flagpole (from the break to the tip). Then, I subtracted the length of the top part of the flagpole (2 feet) from the length of the bottom part of the flagpole (10 feet). This gave me 8 feet, which is the distance from the top of the pole at which the flagpole broke.

Student: Sure! I first calculated the distance covered by John and his dog in 30 minutes. To do this, I took the average speed of the two (6 + 4) / 2 and multiplied it by 0.5 (since 30 minutes is half an hour). This gave me 2.5 miles. Then, I calculated the distance covered by John alone in the next 30 minutes. Since he runs at a speed of 4 mph, I multiplied 4 by 0.5 to get 2 miles. Finally, I added the two distances together to get a total of 4.5 miles.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher:
Student: No, we don't need to average that. Since the problem specifically states that John and his dog run at 6 mph when they are running together, we can just use that speed to calculate the distance they cover in 30 minutes. So, the distance covered by John and his dog in 30 minutes would be 6 * 0.5 = 3 miles. Then, the total distance traveled would be 3 + 2 = 5 miles.

My solution is that Devin's original chances of making the team were 10% since he was 66 inches tall. For every additional inch of height, the chances increase by 10%. Since Devin grew 3 inches from 65 to 68 inches, his chances of making the team have increased by 30% (3 inches x 10% per inch). So, his new chances of making the team are 10% + 30% = 40%.

Student: Sure. I started by figuring out how far the cat can run in 15 minutes, which is 20 x 0.25 = 5 miles. Then I called the time it takes for the rabbit to catch up ""t"". In that time, the cat will have run (t + 0.25) x 20 miles, and the rabbit will have run t x 25 miles. I wanted to find the time when they are even, so I set up the equation 25t = 20t + 5 + 5.

Since she works three overtime shifts this week, she will earn $45 x 3 = $135 from overtime. Therefore, her total earnings for the week will be $150 + $135 = $285.

Student: Sure. I started by figuring out how much money Barbara still needs to save for the watch. I know that the watch costs $100, and she has already saved $20, so she needs to save $100 - $20 = $80 more. Then I figured out how much she has saved from her allowance. She has been saving for 10 weeks, so she has saved 10 x $5 = $50 from her allowance. That means she still needs to save $80 - $50 = $30 more. Finally, I figured out how many weeks she needs to save for the watch. If she continues to save $5 per week, she will need $30 / $5 = 6 more weeks to save up for the watch.

DeAndre: Sure. I started by subtracting the 100,000 copies from the 1,000,000 copies that were sold. That left 900,000 copies. Then I multiplied that number by the $2 per copy that Steve earned, which gave me $1.8 million. Then I multiplied that number by 10% to get the amount that his agent took, which was $162,000. Finally, I subtracted that from the original $1.8 million to get the amount that Steve kept, which was $1,458,000.

Student: Sure! So I started by counting the number of legs on each animal. There are 2 legs on each bird, 4 legs on each dog, no legs on the spider, and 0 or 0 legs on each snake (depending on whether they are venomous or not). Then, I multiplied the number of animals by the number of legs on each animal. For the birds, I multiplied 3 x 2 = 6. For the dogs, I multiplied 5 x 4 = 20. For the snakes, I multiplied 4 x 0 = 0. For the spider, I multiplied 1 x 0 = 0. Finally, I added up the total number of legs on each animal and got 6 + 20 + 0 + 0 = 26 legs in total.
