The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Teacher: Hi Mariana, please talk me through your solution
Student: Sure. I started by letting x be the number of spoons Julia bought. Then I added 5 to x to get the total number of spoons. Next, I subtracted 3 from the total number of spoons to get the number of spoons left. Finally, I set up an equation and solved for x, which was 4. So Julia bought a package of 4 spoons.

Teacher: Okay -  you've overcomplicated this. Let's start again. We know Julia has 12 spoons when setting the table. We also know she used three whilst sampling her stew. How many is that altogether?
Student: 12 - 3 = 9. So Julia had 9 spoons left when setting the table.

3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $500.

Student: In total, you distributed 20 chocolates. Since you said that half of the students wanted a second chocolate, that means 10 students wanted a second one. So you distributed 10 extra chocolates, making a total of 20 chocolates.
Teacher: no i distribute one chocolate to each student first. so 20 chocolates. then half of the students i.e. 10 students wanted a second one therefore 10 more chocolates were distributed. hence the total is 30.
Student: Ah, I see. So you distributed 20 chocolates initially, and then 10 more chocolates for the 10 students who wanted a second one, making a total of 30 chocolates.

Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

Teacher: Hi Claire, can you walk me through your solution?
Student: Sure! I started by working backwards. I knew that Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so I multiplied 5 by 2 to get 10, since she sold half of what she had left at the orange house. Then I added 2, since she sold 2 more to the red house. Finally, I multiplied 10 by 3, since she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. That gave me 36, so I concluded that Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=163 Post-it notes.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure, I started with 80 post-it notes. Then I used 220 post-it notes at work, leaving me with 23 post-it notes remaining. So I used a total of 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes. Since I bought a package of post-it notes, the number of post-it notes I bought is the difference between the total I used and the number I started with: 277 - 80 = 197.
Teacher: Okay, so you've started off well. However, your calculation isn' correct. Can you look again at the calculation in the middle and think about it a bit more?
Student: Oh, I see. I was subtracting the 23 post-it notes from the total number of post-it notes I used, instead of subtracting it from the number I started with. So the correct calculation is 80 + 220 - 80 = 220 post-it notes. So the number of post-it notes I bought is 220 - 80 = 140.

He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = 8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = 2,000 steps.

Teacher: Hi Claire, can you talk me through your method,pleasE? 
Student: Sure! I started by figuring out how many steps Elliott took on his walks to and from school, which was 10,000/2 = 5000 steps. Then I added the 1,000 steps he took with his friend, which was 5000+1000 = 6000 steps. After that, I subtracted the 6000 steps from his goal of 10,000, which was 10,000-6000 = 4000 steps. So in total, he took 4000 steps during his jog.

4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4*.25=$1.00
When you add all her purchases, $4.50+$1.50+$1.00 = $7.00
She had $10 and spent $7 so she had $10-$7 = $3.00 left over

Student: Sally also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. So she spent $1.50 + $1 = $2.50 on other items. So she has $4.50 - $2.50 = $2 left.

Teacher: remember that we need to use addition to find a total, not subtraction.  Can you add up the total of all items spent, remembering that taffy is $4.50?
Student: Yes, Sally spent $4.50 on taffy, $1.50 on seashells, and $1 on magnets. That means she spent a total of $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7 on all items. So she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

This gave me a total interest of $1,825. Then, I added the total interest to the amount borrowed, which gave me a total amount of $5,475.

Teacher: You seem to have misunderstood the question. The interest that Karan has to pay is not calculated for 5 months. It is fixed at the time of borrowing at 10%
Student: Oh, I see. So the total interest she has to pay is 10% of $3,650, which is $365. Then, the total amount she has to pay back is $3,650 + $365 = $4,015. And since she has to pay an equal amount every month, she has to pay $4,015/5 = $803 per month.

First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%
Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%

So, out of 50000 candles, 95% of them won't smell like wet dog, which is 0.95 x 50000 = 47500 candles. Out of the 47500 candles that don't smell like wet dog, 1% of them will still explode, which is 0.01 x 47500 = 475 candles.

Teacher: That is a complete misunderstanding of the question. You have assumed that 5% of the total candles smell like wet dog. But the question mentions 5% of the defective candles smell like wet dog. Do you see your mistake?
Student: Yes, I see my mistake. I should have taken into account that the 5% of the candles that smell like wet dog are only the ones that are defective. So, out of 50000 candles, 5% of them are defective and of those defective candles, 5% of them smell like wet dog. Therefore, 5% of 50000 candles is 2500 candles and 5% of 2500 candles is 125 candles. So, there will be 125 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

He has 3 glasses of water on both weekend days, for 3*2= 6 glasses of water.
He has 20+6=26 total glasses of water in a week.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure! I started by calculating the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays. I multiplied 4 glasses per day by 5 days to get 20 glasses of water. Then, I calculated the number of glasses of water John drinks on the weekends. I added 3 glasses per day for the two days plus 1 glass for the soda to get 4 glasses of water per day. I multiplied 4 glasses per day by 2 days to get 8 glasses of water for the weekend. Finally, I added 20 glasses of water for the weekdays and 8 glasses of water for the weekend to get a total of 28 glasses of water for the week.
Teacher: ok, so we only need to count glasses of water.  John has 4 glasses per day during the week so 4 *5
Student: Yes, that's right. 4 glasses per day for 5 days is 20 glasses of water. Then, on the weekends he has 3 glasses of water plus 1 glass of soda, so 4 glasses of water per day for 2 days is 8 glasses of water. So, 20 + 8 = 28 glasses of water in a week.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = 2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = 14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure. I started by calculating the total interest she has to pay, which is 3,650 x 10/100 x 5 = $1825. Then I added the total interest to the original amount borrowed, which was 3,650 + 1,825 = $5475. Finally, I divided the total amount by the number of months, which was 5, to get the amount she has to pay per month, which is 5475/5 = $1095.
Teacher: there seems to be a mistake here. one doesn't calculate the interest every month
Student: Oh, I see. The interest rate is only applied to the original amount borrowed, not every month. So the total amount she has to pay back is 3,650 + 1825 = $5475. Then I divided the total amount by the number of months, which was 5, to get the amount she has to pay per month, which is 5475/5 = $1095.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $500.

4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4*.25=$1.00
When you add all her purchases, $4.50+$1.50+$1.00 = $7.00
She had $10 and spent $7 so she had $10-$7 = $3.00 left over

Student: Oh, right. She bought a bag of seashells for $1.50. So, Sally spent $4.5 + $1 + $1.50 = $6.5 in total. Therefore, Sally has $10 - $6.5 = $3.5 left.
Teacher: Let's see. If she spent $4.50 on taffy, $1 on magnets, and $1.50 on seashells, can we add those together again?
Student: Yes, we can add those together again. So, Sally spent $4.5 + $1 + $1.50 = $6.5 in total. Therefore, Sally has $10 - $6.5 = $3.5 left.

Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = 8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = 2,000 steps.

Then, I added the 1,000 steps he took with his friend, so I had taken 5000+1000 = 6000 steps. After that, I subtracted 6000 from his goal of 10,000, so I had 10,000-6000 = 4000 steps left to take.

He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = 8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = 2,000 steps.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure. I started by calculating how many steps Elliott took on his walks to and from school. I divided 10,000 steps by 2 to get 5,000 steps. Then, I added the 1,000 steps he took with his friend, which gave me 6,000 steps. Finally, I subtracted 6,000 from 10,000 to get 4,000 steps, which is the number of steps he took during his jog.
Teacher: You already did many things right but let's look at the end of the problem. Are there any steps left to take for Elliott?
Student: Yes, there are still 2,000 steps left for Elliott to take.

Let's imagine the balls are caught by someone in the audience but Josh doesn't have the time to go get them during his performance but only collects them later. How many balls can he immediately juggle with?

If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Teacher: Hi Stephanie, you were nearly right with your answer here. On the first line you calculated that Brian had 15 video games after he lost 5. However, the question said that Brian lost 5 games ""RIGHT BEFORE THE COMPARISON WAS MADE"". Can you update your answer?
Student: Yes, I understand now. Before losing 5 video games, Brian had 20, so Bobby has 3 times as many video games as Brian does which is 3*20 = 60 video games. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does, which means Bobby has 60-5 = 55 video games.

First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = 80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 160 minutes

Student: Sure. I started by calculating the amount of data that had been downloaded before the restart, which was 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Then, I calculated how long it took to download the 80 GB, which was 80/2 = 40 minutes. After that, I added the 20 minutes it took for the restart. Finally, I calculated how long it took to download the remaining 120 GB, which was 120/2 = 60 minutes. So, the total time it took was 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.
5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, 7 new records x 2 old records traded for each = 14 old records that the 5 people brought in.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = 8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = 2,000 steps.

Student: 20 chickens would need 60 cups of feed per day. So, if Wendi has 20 chickens, she would need to give 60 cups of feed per meal and 180 cups of feed for the day.
Teacher: Okay lets think about this differently. If each chicken is give 3 cups per day and they have 3 meals a day. How many cups in theory do they get each meal?
Student: Each chicken would get 3 cups of feed per meal. So, if Wendi has 20 chickens, she would need to give 60 cups of feed per meal and 180 cups of feed for the day.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=20 cups of chicken feed.

Student: Each chicken would get 3 cups of feed per meal. So, if Wendi has 20 chickens, she would need to give 60 cups of feed per meal and 180 cups of feed for the day.
Teacher: Remember it's 3 cups a day. So each meal would only get 1 cup per meal. Can you see where you're adding an extra step?
Student: Oh, I see. I was multiplying 3 cups per meal instead of 3 cups per day. So, for 20 chickens, she needs to give 1 cup of feed per meal, which gives her 20 cups of feed per meal. In total, for the day, she needs to give 20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed. She has already given 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. Therefore, in the final meal, she needs to give 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed.

3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $300 added to the initial cost of the desk.

Teacher: Explain your answer
Student: I started with the opening bid of $200 and then added $50 for each subsequent bid. Since there were 3 other people who each bid once, I added $50 three times, which brought the total to $350. So the desk cost Carmen $350
",probing

This is the correct solution of a problem:
3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $500.

Then I subtract the number of pages he already read, 15 pages, so I'm left with 24 pages. Finally, I divide 24 by the number of days he has left, 5 days, to get an average of 4.8 pages per day.
Teacher: He has already spent a day reading 15 pages. 
Student: Right, so I need to subtract 15 from the total number of pages he needs to read, which is 39-15 = 24 pages. Then, I divide 24 by the number of days he has left, which is 5 days, to get an average of 4.8 pages per day.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.
So the discount for 2 tubs of ice cream is $2 x 2 = $4.
The total discount for 4 packets of milk is $0.5 x 4 = $2.
You will save $4 + $2 = $6 for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:

Since 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, that means 95% of the candles don't have that defect. So, out of 50000 candles, 95% of them won't smell like wet dog, which is 0.95 x 50000 = 47500 candles.

Then, I calculated the number of candles that will explode. Out of the 47500 candles that don't smell like wet dog, 1% of them will still explode, which is 0.01 x 47500 = 475 candles.

Then, I calculated the number of candles that will explode. Out of the 47500 candles that don't smell like wet dog, 1% of them will still explode, which is 0.01 x 47500 = 475 candles.

Therefore, there will be 475 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.
Teacher: no you see, we need to find out the number the candles that smell like dog and also explodes, both. so 1% candles that explode should not be calculated on the candles that do not smell.
Student: Oh, I see. So, I need to start by calculating the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, that means 5% of the 50000 candles will smell like wet dog, which is 0.05 x 50000 = 2500 candles. Then, I need to calculate the number of candles that will explode. Out of the 2500 candles that smell like wet dog, 1% of them will still explode, which is 0.01 x 2500 = 25 candles. Therefore, there will be 25 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

Teacher: Hi, do you want to talk me through your solution?
Student: Sure! I started by figuring out how many cups of feed she needs to give each chicken per meal. Since she has 20 chickens, I multiplied 3 cups of feed by 20 chickens, which gave me 60 cups of feed per meal.

Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = 95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

Since each box holds 24 pencils, I divided 70 by 24 to get 2.92 boxes. Since they can't have a fraction of a box, I rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 boxes. So, they need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
There are a total of 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the three boxes.
Thus, each box can contain 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.
Together, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.
Therefore, they need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes to put in all their pencils.

Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50
4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4*.25=$1.00
When you add all her purchases, $4.50+$1.50+$1.00 = $7.00
She had $10 and spent $7 so she had $10-$7 = $3.00 left over

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Teacher: Hi there Emily! Your answer to this question was not correct. Read the offer again carefully. Taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 point at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So how much is 2 pounds of taffy?
Student: Oh, I see. 2 pounds of taffy would be $3 + $1.50 = $4.50. So Sally spent $4.50 on the taffy, $1.50 on the seashells, and $1 on the magnets. That means Sally has $10 - $4.50 - $1.50 - $1 = $3 left.

Student: Oh, I see. So, since there are 26 girls in the choir, then half of them can't make it, so only 13 girls can perform. With the 3 teachers, that makes 16 people who sang in the performance.

Student: Sure, so I started by figuring out how much money Billy had left to spend on candy after buying the gumballs. He had $10 to start with, and spent $0.05 x 40 = $2 on gumballs, so he had $5 - $2 = $3 left to spend on candy. Then I figured out how many pounds of candy he could buy with that amount of money. He could buy $3/$1.5 per pound = 2 pounds of candy. Therefore, Billy bought 2 pounds of candy.

We know that the total number of spoons is x + 5, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 5 = 12 

Subtracting 5 from both sides: 

x = 7 

So Julia bought a package of 7 spoons. 
7
Teacher: lets not think of the origional number being x as i think this is confusing you. what is the numbers we need to extract from the question 
Student: The question tells us that Julia bought a package of spoons and her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So we know that the total number of spoons before she used any was the number of spoons in the package she bought plus 5. We also know that after she used 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. So we can set up the equation 12 = x + 5, and then subtract 5 from both sides to get x = 7. So Julia bought a package of 7 spoons. 7

This is the correct solution of a problem:
First find how many calories per hour Brandon gets from squirrels: 300 calories/squirrel * 6 squirrels = 1800 calories
Then find how many calories per hour Brandon gets from rabbits: 800 calories/rabbit * 2 rabbits = 1600 calories
Then subtract the number of calories per hour from rabbits from the number from squirrels to find the difference: 1800 calories - 1600 calories = 200 calories

Teacher: Morning Ayisha, can you talk me through your solution?
Student: Sure! I started by calculating how many rabbits and squirrels Brandon can catch in an hour. I found that he can catch 6 squirrels or 3 rabbits in an hour. Then I calculated the calories he would get if he caught 6 squirrels and 3 rabbits. I found that he would get 1800 calories for 6 squirrels and 2400 calories for 3 rabbits.

Student: Sure, I started with 25 sprigs of parsley. Carmen used 8 whole sprigs, so that left her with 25-8 = 17 sprigs. She then used 12 half sprigs, which is equivalent to 6 whole sprigs (since 2 half sprigs make 1 whole sprig), so she used a total of 8+6 = 14 whole sprigs. Therefore, Carmen has 17-14 = 3 parsley sprigs left.

So Loraine made 2 large animals and 6 small animals, for a total of 2(4) + 6(2) = 16 sticks of wax used.
Teacher: Ok, can you expand your final solution. What is 2(4)?
DeAndre: 2(4) is 8, since 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. So 2(4) + 6(2) is 8 + 12, which is equal to 16.

Student: Yes, I added the original 25 songs to my first total and my second total because the total duration of the album is the sum of the duration of the original 25 songs and the duration of the 10 additional songs. So, the total duration of the album is 75 minutes (from the original 25 songs) plus 105 minutes (from the 10 additional songs), which equals 180 minutes.
Teacher: You have already used the 75 minutes twice
Student: Yes, I have used the 75 minutes twice because the total duration of the album is the sum of the duration of the original 25 songs and the duration of the 10 additional songs.

I then set up the equation 40 - x = 24 + 4, since that was the amount he had left and half of his original money plus $4. After simplifying the equation, I solved for x and got x = 20, which meant that Sid spent $20 on computer accessories.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Half of Sid's original money is $48/2 = $24.
Sid has only $24 + $4 = $28 left after his purchases.
He had $28 + $8 = $36 before he spent $8 on snacks.
So, Sid spent $48 - $36 = $12 on computer accessories.

Student: Sure. On the current Black Friday, the store sold 327 televisions, which is 50 more than last year. So last year they sold 327 - 50 = 277 televisions. If they sell 50 more televisions each year for three years, the number of televisions sold in the next three years will be: Year 1: 327, Year 2: 327 + 50 = 377, Year 3: 377 + 50 = 427. So, they will sell 427 televisions on Black Friday three years from now.
Teacher: If I were a Tshirt seller and I sold 10 Tshirts last Saturday and this Saturday I sold 2 more than last week. Would I need to subtract or add the Tshirts to last Saturday's total?
Student: You would need to add the Tshirts to last Saturday's total. So if last Saturday you sold 10 Tshirts, this Saturday you would have sold 10 + 2 = 12 Tshirts.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
The electronics store sold 327 televisions this Black Friday and might sell 50 more televisions the next year, for a total of 327 + 50 = 377 televisions.
The second year they might sell 377 + 50 = 427 televisions.
The third year, if they continue to sell 50 more televisions than they did the previous year, they will sell 427 + 50 televisions = 477 televisions on the Black Friday three years from now.

Student: You would need to add the Tshirts to last Saturday's total. So if last Saturday you sold 10 Tshirts, this Saturday you would have sold 10 + 2 = 12 Tshirts.
Teacher: Ok so look at this part of the problem 'On Black Friday a popular electronics store sells 327 televisions. This is 50 more than they sold last Black Friday.' In your workings you subtract the 50 TVs. Do you still agree with your calculation?
Student: No, I agree that I should have added the 50 TVs instead of subtracting them. So last year they sold 327 + 50 = 377 televisions. If they sell 50 more televisions each year for three years, the number of televisions sold in the next three years will be: Year 1: 377, Year 2: 377 + 50 = 427, Year 3: 427 + 50 = 477. So, they will sell 477 televisions on Black Friday three years from now.

Teacher: We know there are 24 legs/paws in the pool. We know Daisy and Rose are in the pool. We know humans have 2 legs each. Before we start working out how many dogs what should we do with the 4 human legs included in the 24 leg total count?
Student: We should subtract the 4 human legs from the 24 leg total count, so the equation would be 4x + 4y = 20. Then we can simplify the equation to x + y = 5, and the only possible combination of whole numbers that add up to 5 is 2 and 3. Therefore, Daisy and Rose have a total of 2 + 3 = 5 dogs.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Since each person needs 2 sandwiches, she would need 48 mini croissants.
Teacher: Good! So if she needs 48 croissants, how much will that cost?
Student: The bakery offers 12 mini croissants for $8.00, so she would need to buy 48/12 = 4 sets of 12 mini croissants. Thus, she would spend 4 x $8.00 = $32.00 on croissants.

Teacher: look at what i have wrote there are 3 components which break down to 2 x dozens and 1 x half a dozen. use this to help you solve the problem
Student: Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 pens. Half of a dozen is equal to 6, so one and a half dozen is equal to 1 x 12 + 6 = 18 pens. Therefore, two and a half dozen of pens is equal to 24 + 18 = 42 pens.

Student: First, I added up Yulia's total earnings from her lemonade stand and babysitting, which was $44 + $47 + $31 = $122. Then, I let x be the amount she spent to run her lemonade stand. After that, I figured out her profit was $47 - x. Since we know her total profit was $44, I set up an equation: $47 - x = $44. Finally, I solved for x and got x = $3.

After Erika’s mom brought out the additional chalk, there were 21 - 12 = 9 pieces of chalk left from the new batch. So, they originally had 9 - 2 = 7 pieces of chalk to begin with.
Teacher: cody you have correctly calculated that there were 7 kids. now, after erika's mom brought 12 pieces of chalks , all of them had 21. you have calculated till this part correctly. but then what should you do find out , How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?
Student: Yes, after Erika's mom brought 12 pieces of chalk, there were 21 pieces in total. To find out how many pieces of chalk Erika and her siblings originally had, I need to subtract the 12 pieces from the 21 pieces. So, 21 - 12 = 9 pieces of chalk were left from the new batch. This means they originally had 9 - 2 = 7 pieces of chalk to begin with.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Altogether, there are 1 Erika + 3 siblings + 3 friends = 7 people drawing outside.
The group has a total of 7 people * 3 pieces of chalk each = 21 pieces of chalk altogether.
Before Erika’s mom helped, they had 21 total pieces of chalk - 12 pieces of chalk Erika’s mom brought = 9 pieces of chalk.
Then adding the chalk that Erika lost shows that the group originally had 9 pieces of chalk + 2 lost pieces of chalk = 11 pieces of chalk.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = 8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = 2,000 steps.

Teacher: We are going to look at this in a slightly different way than the way you have in your solution. Firstly, you can see that the result of the division is almost 3. What do you think the next step should be?
Student: Since the result of the division is almost 3, we can subtract the result from 3 to get the difference. The difference is 0.18181818. We can then add the difference to the sum of all the numbers (31) to get the answer. So, the answer is 31 + 0.18181818 = 31.18181818. So Ronald needs to roll a 4.18181818 on the next roll to be able to stop.

The next roll will be his 11th roll.
The total on this tenth roll to have an average of 3 is 33, because 3 * 11 = 33
His current total is 31 because 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 2= 31
He needs to roll a 2 because 33 - 31 = 2

Student: Since the result of the division is almost 3 and we have rolled the dice 11 times, we can divide the difference (0.18181818) by 11 to get the amount that needs to be added to the sum of all the numbers (31).

Teacher: in that case what does the amount 160 in step one represent?
Student: The amount 160 in step one represents the combined total of the two other harbors. I multiplied 80 (the amount of lobster in each of the two other harbors) by 2 to get the combined total of 160 pounds of lobster.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Since the other two harbors have 80 pounds of lobsters each, they have a total of 80+80= 160 pounds of lobster.
Since Hooper Bay has two times more lobsters than the other two harbors combined, it has 2*160 = 320 pounds of lobster.
In total, the three harbors have 320+160 = 480 pounds of lobster.

Student: Yes, you would need to divide 60/100 to find out how much she spent on hats, which is $10. Then, you would need to multiply $10 by the amount of money she currently has, which is $90, to find out how much she spent on scarves, which is $80.
Teacher: No, multiply 0.6 by 90 to get 54 dollars
Student: Yes, you would need to multiply 0.6 by $90 to get $54, which is the amount of money she spent on scarves. Then, subtracting $54 from $90 would give us the amount of money she spent on hats, which is $36.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Kiki spends 60/100*$90=$54 of her money on hats.
The amount she spends on buying scarves is $90-$54=$36
If each scarf is sold at $2, Kiki will buy $36/$2=18 scarves.

Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Teacher: Hi. Could you please why you added  $1000 at the end of the calculation?
Student: Sure. In order to make $60000 in a year, the shoe company needs to make an additional $12000. Since there are 12 months in a year, I divided the $12000 by 12 to get the amount of extra money they need to make each month, which is $1000.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
The amount of money they currently make in a year is 12 * 4000 = $48000.
The additional amount they need to make is $60000 - $48000= $12000 per year.
So, they should make $12000 / 12 = $1000 more every month.

Teacher: Okay. But why did you add $ 1000 with $ 4000 and the end?
Student: Because I needed to find the total amount of money they need to make each month to reach their goal of $60000 in a year. So I added the $4000 they already make each month plus the extra $1000 they need to make each month to get the total of $5000 per month.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure. There are 6 people eating at Tom's house, so 6 x 3 = 18 plates are used each day. Then, 18 x 4 = 72 plates are used in 4 days. Since each person uses 2 plates per meal, then they use 2 x 3 = 6 plates per day. So, Tom and his guests use 6 x 4 = 24 plates in 4 days. Hence, a total of 72 + 24 = 96 plates are used altogether.
Teacher: Ok. Let's focus on something different. James and Cody are brothers. Both of them have two kinds of pens, say A and B. James has 2 pens of kind A and 3 pens of kind B. Cody has 7 pens of kind A and 5 pens of kind B. If each pen of kind A costs $1 and that of kind B costs $2, how much each one of them spent to get those pens?
Student: James spent 2 x $1 + 3 x $2 = $7 for his pens and Cody spent 7 x $1 + 5 x $2 = $17 for his pens. So, James spent $7 and Cody spent $17.

Student: Sure. To get 0.5 miles per week, I divided the goal (120 miles per week) by the number of weeks (40) to get 0.5 miles per week. So, 120 ÷ 40 = 0.5.
Teacher: Did you double check your solution? Does 120 divide 40 = 0.5 make sense? 
Student: Yes, I double checked my solution and it makes sense. 120 divided by 40 is 0.5, which means he needs to increase his mileage by 0.5 miles per week in order to reach his goal of 120 miles per week in 40 weeks.

Teacher: What is the process for dividing two numbers? 
Student: The process for dividing two numbers is to divide the dividend (the number being divided) by the divisor (the number that is dividing the dividend). In this case, the dividend is 120 and the divisor is 40, so 120 ÷ 40 = 0.5.

In each panel, the metal sheets use 3 metal sheets * 10 metal rods = 30 metal rods.
In each panel, the metal beams use 2 metal beams * 4 metal rods = 8 metal rods.
So each panel uses 30 + 8 = 38 metal rods.
The entire fence therefore needs 38 metal rods * 10 fence panels = 380 metal rods.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Mariana: Oh, right! We need to divide the total cost by two. So I did $3000/2 = $1500, which is the amount James paid
Teacher: Remember you worked out that the total amount would be 150
Mariana: Oh, right! The total amount would be $150 x 200 = $3000. Then I divided that by two because he split it evenly with his roommate, so $3000/2 = $1500. That's how I got my answer of $1500

This is the correct solution of a problem:
The total bill before taxes or gratuities was $80 for the steak + $10 for the wine = $80+$10 = $90
If the tax is 10%, then the taxes paid were $90 * 10% = $9
That means that the total bill before gratuities was $90 + $9 = $99
If the final bill was $140, then you were charged $140-$99 = $41 for gratuities

Teacher: Hi Claire, talk me through your solution
Student: I started by calculating the total cost of the food and drinks before taxes and gratuities, which was $80 + $10 = $90. Then I calculated the tax on the food and drinks, which was 10/100 x $90 = $9. After that, I added the tax to the total bill, which was $90 + $9 = $99. Finally, I calculated the gratuity, which was 10/100 x $140 = $14. So, the shady restaurant charged $14 for gratuities.

Mariana: Oh, right! So that means Danielle's travel time would be 90 minutes, and Cameron's travel time would be 30 minutes. That means it would take Chase 30 minutes to travel from Granville to Salisbury.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
If Danielle drives at three times the speed of Cameron, it will take Cameron 30*3=90 minutes for Cameron to travel the same distance.
And since Cameron drives at twice the speed of his brother, Chase, it will take Chase 90*2=180 minutes to travel from Granville to Salisbury.

Student: That's true. There is nothing mentioned about the other 10 customers, so we can assume that they did not buy enough bowls to get any reward. That means the total number of bowls bought was 20 x 20 + 10 x 0 = 400. Then, Howard would give out 2/10 x 400 = 80 bowls as rewards. That means he would be left with 70 - 80 = 10 bowls, which is possible. So, there are still 10 wooden bowls remaining in the rewards collection.
Teacher: Half of the 20 customers, which is 1/2*20=10 bought 20 bowls each, receiving 2 for every 10.
The total number of reward bowls each customer who bought 20 bowls received is 2+2=4
If 10 customers bought 20 bowls, Howard gave away 4*10=40 bowls as rewards.
The total number of reward bowls that remained is 70-40=30

I should have divided both sides by 2 to get x = 22.50. That means that a single brown sock costs 22.50 cents. So, 15 brown socks would cost 15 x 22.50 = $337.50 cents.

Teacher: Good try, but think again about your initial equation. There are two errors. First think about the units you have used. Can you see where these need to be altered? 
Student: Yes, I see now that I should have written 2(x + 0.25) = 0.45 instead of 2(x + 0.25) = 45. That way, the units would be consistent. Then, when I simplified the equation, I should have gotten 2x = 0.45 instead of 2x = 44.5. After dividing both sides by 2, I would have gotten x = 0.225, which is the same as x = 22.50.

Student: Sure! I started by letting x be the length of the base of the triangle. Then I added the left side of 12 cm and the right side of x + 2 cm and set the equation equal to 50. Then I simplified the equation by subtracting 14 from both sides to get 2x = 36. Then I divided both sides by 2 to get x = 18. So the value of the triangle base is 18 cm.

If Chloe sold 50 dozens, then she was able to sell 50/ 1/2 = 100 half a dozen chocolate-dipped strawberries.
Hence, her profit is $5 x 100 = $500.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Yes, that makes sense. So Chloe's profit for 50 dozens of chocolate-dipped strawberries is $250 x 2 = $1500.
Teacher: Use a calculator for $250 x 2
Student: Sure. $250 x 2 = $500. So Chloe's profit for 50 dozens of chocolate-dipped strawberries is $500.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure. I started by letting the amount each friend contributed be ""x"". Then I said that the total contribution before Harry added his $30 was 3x. After Harry added his $30, the total contribution became 3 times as much as Harry's contribution, which is x + $30. So I wrote the equation 3x = x + $30. Then I simplified the equation to 2x = $30 and solved for x, which was $15. Therefore, each friend contributed $15.
Teacher: Ok, so we know that Harry contributed $30. then the total amount was 3 times what Harry contributed.  So we need to work out 3 x $30
Student: Right, so 3 x $30 = $90. Then we know that Harry's friends each contributed an equal amount, so we can divide $90 by 3 to get $30. So each friend contributed $30.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
If the total contribution was three times as much as Harry contributed, and Harry contributed $30, the total contribution was 3*$30=$90
Since Harry contributed $30, his three friends together contributed $90-$30=$60
Since the three friends were contributing an equal amount, each friend contributed $60/3=$20.

Teacher: But Harry contributed $30, so first we need to subtract that from the total amount
Student: Oh, right. So $90 - $30 = $60. Then we can divide $60 by 3 to get $20, which is the amount each friend contributed.

",telling

This is the correct solution of a problem:
If the bakery can make 12 pies, this means there would be 12 * 3 = 36 pie pieces.
For all the pieces the bakery would make 36 * 4 = $144.
The cost of making 12 pies is 12 * 0.5 = $6.
That means the bakery would make 144 - 6 = $138.
 138
The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: 12 pies x $0.5 = $6
Teacher: Yes. You do not need to multiply this by 3 because you only need to know the total number of pies not the pieces it makes
Student: Got it, so the total cost of making 12 pies is $6 and the total profit from selling all the pieces is $144 - $6 = $138

Student: Hi, sure. I started by adding up the amount of time Amaya watched the movie uninterrupted, which was 35 + 45 + 20 = 100 minutes. Then I added the time she spent rewinding, which was 5 + 15 = 20 minutes. So in total, it took her 100 + 20 = 120 minutes to watch the movie.
Teacher: That's correct, although the original answer you gave was 140 minutes, can you compare your approaches and see where you went wrong originally?
Student: Sure. I originally added up the total viewing time and the total rewinding time, which was 35 + 5 + 45 + 15 + 20 = 140 minutes. I realized I had added up the total viewing time twice, so I corrected my answer to be the total viewing time plus the total rewinding time, which was 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

If 5,000 square feet represents one-quarter of the second floor storage space, then the second floor has 5,000*4=20,000 square feet of storage space.
Since the first floor has twice as much space as the second floor, then the first floor has 20,000*2=40,000 square feet of storage space.
Altogether, when empty, the entire building has 20,000+40,000=60,000 square feet of storage space.
Since the second floor has 5,000 square feet of storage space filled with boxes, then there are 60,000-5,000=55,000 square feet of unused storage space still available in the building.

Teacher: Hi Cody, could you please walk me through your solution?
Student: Sure. I started by calculating the storage space of the second floor, which is 5000 square feet. Then I multiplied that by two to get the storage space of the first floor, which is 10000 square feet. Then I multiplied the storage space of the second floor by four to get the total storage space of the building, which is 20000 square feet. Finally, I subtracted the 5000 square feet of storage space used by the boxes to get the total available storage space of 15000 square feet.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, Ephraim bought 30 ducks / 2 = 15 ducks.
Since Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, Kolton bought 45 ducks + 15 ducks = 60 ducks
The total number of ducks the three bought is 60 ducks + 15 ducks + 30 ducks = 105 ducks
The average number of ducks each bought is 105 ducks / 3 people = 35 ducks/person

300m is a quarter of the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak so (1/4)*distance from riverbed to peak = 300m
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 gives the distance from riverbed to peak = 300m*4 = 1200m
The height of the hill is the difference between the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak and the distance from the riverbed to the hill's base which is 1200m-300m = 900m

Student: Oh, I see. I added 6 to the 12 phones that Kevin had to repair in the afternoon instead of the 15 phones he had to repair at the beginning of the day. So, each person needs to repair 9 phones. Thank you for pointing that out.

Teacher: you see heidi. maggie sold twice the amount of magazine subscription to another neighbour implies twice of what she sold to her next-door neighbour and not twice the total
Student: Oh, I see. So I should have multiplied the 2 magazine subscriptions she sold to her next-door neighbor by 2 instead of adding the total number of subscriptions she sold to her family and neighbor. That means Maggie sold 2 x 2 = 4 magazine subscriptions to the other neighbor. In total, she sold 7+4 = 11 magazine subscriptions. Therefore, Maggie earned 11 x $5.00 = $55.00.

There are fresh mangos in 36 / 6 = 6 dishes.
Thus, there are 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 dishes with mango on the buffet.
Oliver can pick the mango out of 2 of the dishes, so there are 10 - 2 = 8 dishes he won't eat.
Thus, there are 36 - 8 = 28 dishes left for Oliver on the buffet.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure! First, I counted the number of dishes with mango in them. There are 3 dishes with mango salsa, 36/6 = 6 dishes with fresh mangoes, and 1 dish with mango jelly. That's a total of 10 dishes with mango. Then, I subtracted the number of dishes with fresh mango that Oliver won't eat. There are 36/6 = 6 dishes with fresh mango, but Oliver won't eat 2 of them, so I subtracted 2 from the total. That leaves 4 dishes with fresh mango that Oliver can try. Finally, I subtracted the 10 dishes with mango and the 4 dishes with fresh mango that Oliver won't try, which leaves a total of 22 dishes for Oliver on the buffet.
Teacher: Brilliant. So we know that Oliver doesn't like mangoes and 10 of the dishes have mango. Does it specify that he only won't eat fresh mango or any mango? So if we take away the 2 dishes that Oliver can pick out the mango from the 10 dishes, how many dishes does that leave us?
Student: That leaves us with 8 dishes with mango that Oliver won't eat. Then, we subtract the 4 dishes with fresh mango that Oliver won't try, which leaves us with a total of 22 dishes for Oliver on the buffet.

For example If I had a ratio of red candles to blue candles as 3:2 and there were 6 red candles, we would know that there must be a total of 15 candles as 3x5=15. To find the number of blue candles we would divide 15 by 3 to make 5 which leaves us with subtracting 5 from 6 to make 1. Can you apply this to our equation? 
Student: Sure, in our equation we have a ratio of 5:3 and 45 red candles. So, to find the total number of candles, we would multiply 5x3 which gives us 15. Then, we would subtract 15 from 45 to get 30. To find the number of blue candles, we would divide 30 by 3 which gives us 10. So, there are 10 blue candles.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
If the ratio of red candles to blue candles Avianna bought was 5:3, then the total ratio was 5+3 = 8.
If 5 represented 45 candles in the total ratio, then 8, the actual ratio, represents 8*45 = 360 divided by 5 is 360/5 = 72 candles.
If the total number of candles was 72, then the number of blue candles is 72 candles - 45 candles = 27 candles

Student: So the second pair of shoes cost $30 (60/2), the first pair of shoes was discounted and cost $20 (40/2), and the extra discount applied to that pair was $20 (80/4). Subtracting the discount from the total, the final cost was 80-20 = $60.

The second spray kills 25%, but 5% have already been killed by the 50% spray, so it kills 25 - 5 = 20%.
After the second spray kills 20% of the remaining germs, there will be 50 - 20 = 30% left.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Teacher: Hi , could you please walk me through your solution?
Student: Sure! First, I used the first spray which kills 50% of the germs, leaving 50% remaining. Then, I used the second spray which kills 25% of the remaining germs, leaving 75% of the original germs. However, 5% of the germs were already killed by the first spray, so I subtracted that from the remaining germs: 75% - 5% = 70%. Therefore, using both sanitizer sprays together would leave 70% of the germs remaining.

Teacher: your method is correct heidi. but you see if 5% germs are common then isn't it included in both 50% and 25%?
Student: Oh, I see! Yes, that's true. So, if 5% of the germs are already killed by the first spray, then we need to subtract that from the 50% killed by the first spray and the 25% killed by the second spray. That means that the total percentage of germs killed by both sprays together would be 50% - 5% + 25% - 5% = 65%. Therefore, using both sanitizer sprays together would leave 65% of the germs remaining.

Teacher: my bad. you were correct. after using both sanitiser sprays 70% germs would be killed but then you also need to find the amount of remaining germs. that is what the question asks for.
Student: Ah, I understand now. So, if 70% of the germs are killed by both sprays, then the remaining percentage of germs would be 100% - 70% = 30%. Therefore, using both sanitizer sprays together would leave 30% of the germs remaining.

We can get that number by subtracting the number of books he donated (45 + 43 = 88) from the original number of books he had (99). That gives us 99 - 88 = 11 books. Then we add the 12 books he took from the box to get the final number of books. 11 + 12 = 23 books. So Henry now has 68 books
Teacher: Please add the number of books Henry has left plus the number of books Henry picks up from the free box.
DeAndre: Henry had 99 - 88 = 11 books left before taking the 12 books from the ""free to a good home"" box. After taking the 12 books, Henry now has 11 + 12 = 23 books. So Henry now has 68 books

He filled 3 boxes with 15 books each so 3*15 = 45 books
From the rest of his house he is donating 45+21+4+18 = 88 books for donation
His collection is 99 books and he is donating 88 books, so that leaves him with 99-88 = 11 books

Then find how many feet closer the dragon gets each second by subtracting Xena's speed from the dragon's speed: 30 ft/sec - 15 ft/sec = 15 ft/sec
Then divide the distance by the speed difference to find how many seconds it takes for the dragon to get close enough to burn Xena: 480 ft / 15 ft/sec = 32 sec

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: The dragon needs to close a gap of 600 feet plus 120 feet to catch up to Xena, so 720 feet in total.
Teacher: What's the gap between 600 and 120?
Student: The gap between 600 and 120 is 480 feet.

The answer would be the number of rounds it would take to fill the pool (110 / 5 = 22).
Teacher: perfect can you see how you got to this correct solution now? 
Student: Yes, I can see how I got to the correct solution. By using algebra, I was able to solve for x, which was the number of rounds George needed to fill the pool. By using the trial and error method, I was able to calculate the total number of buckets they would have carried after each round and compare it to the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool. And by using the simpler method, I was able to divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool by the number of buckets George and Harry can carry in one round to get the number of rounds it would take to fill the pool.

Let's say the river's length in the straight part of the river is x.
The total length of the river is the length of the straight part plus 3 times the length of the straight part for the crooked part, which is x+3x = 80
The total length of the river is 4x=80
The straight part of the river is x=80/4 = 20 miles.

Teacher: guide me through your thinking please?
Student: I started by letting x be the length of the crooked part of the river. Then I used the given information that the length of the straight part of the river is three times shorter than the crooked part, so I set up the equation x + 3x = 80. I then simplified the equation to 4x = 80 and solved for x to get x = 20. Finally, I used the value of x to calculate the length of the straight part of the river, which is 3x = 3(20) = 60 miles.

Therefore, she sold 18 cups to the crew and kept 18 cups for herself and her friends. So, she made a total of 18 + 18 = 36 cups of lemonade.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = 9 cups, away to friends.
Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = 28 cups.
Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew.
In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = 56 cups of lemonade.

The total number of ducks the three bought is 60 ducks + 15 ducks + 30 ducks = 105 ducks
The average number of ducks each bought is 105 ducks / 3 people = 35 ducks/person

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Since Ephraim has 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, Kolton has 45 + 15 = 60 ducks.
Teacher: can you figure out the average number of ducks now?
Student: Yes. The average number of ducks the three bought is (30+60+15)/3 = 105/3 = 35.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Teacher: Hi Mariana, You have made a mistake in your solution.  Please can you talk me through your thinking.
Student: Sure, I started by setting up an equation for the number of presents. I said that the number of Christmas presents is twice as many as the number of birthday presents, so I set up the equation: Number of Christmas presents = 2x. Then I knew that the total number of presents was 60, so I set up the equation: Total number of presents = x + 2x = 3x. Then I solved for x by dividing both sides by 3, so x = 20. Finally, I found the total number of presents by multiplying 3 and 20, so 3x = 3(20) = 60.

The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Sure. I started by calculating how much toothpaste each family member uses per day. I added up Anne's dad, mom, Anne and her brother, which was 3+2+1+1 = 7 grams of toothpaste per day. Then, I multiplied that by the number of family members, which was 4, to get 28 grams of toothpaste per day. Finally, I divided the total amount of toothpaste (105 grams) by the amount used per day (28 grams) to get the number of days it would take for the toothpaste to run out. Since they can't use a partial day of toothpaste, the toothpaste will last for 3 days.
Teacher: You have a step that is wrong. Let's walk through the problem together. How much toothpaste does Anne's family use at each brushing?
Student: Anne's dad uses 3 grams, her mom uses 2 grams, Anne and her brother use 1 gram each. So, the total amount of toothpaste used per brushing is 3+2+1+1 = 7 grams.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
Anne and her brother use 1 gram + 1 gram = 2 grams.
Anne's dad uses 3 grams and Anne's mom uses 2 grams so together they use 2 grams + 3 grams + 2 grams = 7 grams/wash
Each day, the family uses 7 grams/wash * 3 washes/day = 21 grams.
Using that amount daily, the toothpaste will last 105 grams / 21 grams/day = 5 days.

Then, I added this to the total cost of the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday papers, which was $36. This gave me a total of $36 + $16 = $52, which is how much she spends on newspapers over 8 weeks.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
She buys Wednesday, Thursday and Friday's paper for $0.50 each so that's 3*.50 = $1.50
She spends $1.50 for the weekday papers and $2.00 for the Sunday paper for a total of 1.5+2 = $3.50 a week
Over 8 weeks she spends 8*3.5 = $28.00

First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = 12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers
Then triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = 21 customers
Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = 19 customers
 19
The following is a fragment of a conversation between a student and a teacher discussing the student solution:
Student: Right, so the number of customers kicked out for violence is 10 shoplifters x 3 = 30 customers.
Teacher: Triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = 21 customers
Student: Got it! So the total number of customers kicked out is 3 + 10 + 21 = 34 customers. To find the number kicked out for other reasons, I subtract the above number from the total: 50 - 34 = 16 customers.

Teacher: She won 5 tickets from the games, and she played 5 games. So how many tickets did she win per game?
Student: She won 5 tickets per game. 5 tickets x 5 games = 25 tickets and 5 tickets on the floor = 30 tickets total.

This is the correct solution of a problem:
The insurance cost 24*20=$480

Teacher: Hi Luca, can you tell me how you got your answer?
Student: Sure, I used the equation 24 x $20 = $480 to calculate the total cost of the pet insurance. Then I used the equation $5000 x 0.2 = $1000 to calculate the amount that Tom was responsible for paying. Finally, I subtracted the amount that Tom paid from the total cost of the surgery to get the amount that he saved, which was $5000 - $1000 = $4000.
